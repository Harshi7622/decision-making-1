# Get input from the user
birth_year_last_two = int(input("Enter the last two digits of your birth year: "))
current_year_last_two = int(input("Enter the last two digits of the current year: "))

# Calculate the birth year and current year
# Assume the birth year is in the 1900s if the last two digits are less than the current year
if birth_year_last_two > current_year_last_two:
    birth_year = 1900 + birth_year_last_two
else:
    birth_year = 2000 + birth_year_last_two

current_year = 2000 + current_year_last_two

# Calculate the age
age = current_year - birth_year

# Print the user's current age
print(age)
